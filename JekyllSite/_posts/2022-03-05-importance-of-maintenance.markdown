You've got that side project you were working on, right? It's been a few months, work has been busy, life has been happening, so it's not like you've done much with it. But you've got a nice clear weekend afternoon, with a few free hours you've already mentally earmarked to work on that new thing you wanted to add to it. Except you pick it up, and it's like it's been written by another person - spaghetti everywhere, dozens of TODO comments, the styling is completely broken and doing an `npm i` reveals a frankly terrifying list of packages needing updating.

Maybe I'll just go do the washing up instead...
