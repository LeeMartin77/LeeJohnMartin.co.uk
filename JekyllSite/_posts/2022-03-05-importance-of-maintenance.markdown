You've got that side project you were working on, right? It's been a few months, work has been busy, life has been happening, so it's not like you've done much with it. But you've got a nice clear weekend afternoon, with a few free hours you've already mentally earmarked to work on that new thing you wanted to add to it. Except you pick it up, and it's like it's been written by another person - spaghetti everywhere, dozens of TODO comments, the styling is completely broken and doing an `npm i` reveals a frankly terrifying list of packages needing updating.

Maybe I'll just go do the washing up instead...

## Good Intentions

Usually starts with wanting to "get it working"

Start piling up technical debt to "make something"

Get it working, but coming back is painful

## Not the Day Job

We spend enough time in the day job having to trade business need against technical requirements

Your personal projects should try and be a space where you can do the nice clean things you want

No one is telling you what to do - so why not take the time to build it out with all the bells and whistles?

## Future You

Projects setup this way are so nice to come back to, because it tends toward small pieces of improvement

Being able to open your laptop for half an hour, make small but measurable improvements, then walk away again

Also means your project can be an exemplar of your best work - even if the end result isn't useful to anyone else
